Fiscal Year Closing Wizard
--------------------------

Generalization of l10n_es_fiscal_year_closing (http://apps.openerp.com/addon/4506)

Replaces the default OpenERP end of year wizards (from account module)
with a more advanced all-in-one wizard that will let the users:

* Check for unbalanced moves, moves with invalid dates or period or draft moves on the fiscal year to be closed.
* Create the Loss and Profit entry.
* Create the Net Loss and Profit entry.
* Create the Closing entry.
* Create the Opening entry.

It is stateful, saving all the info about the fiscal year closing, so the
user can cancel and undo the operations easily.
